Absolutely! Here's a clear and complete **recap of the steps** you followed (and need to follow again in future) to:

‚úÖ Create a GitHub repo
‚úÖ Connect it with your Ubuntu terminal
‚úÖ Push files using a **personal access token (PAT)** (since GitHub no longer accepts passwords)

---

## üîÅ **Steps to Push a File from Ubuntu to GitHub Using PAT**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Create a GitHub Repository**

* Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
* Click **New Repository**
* Name it (e.g., `linux-practice-and-devops-notes`)
* Keep it **public** or **private** as you wish
* Do **not** initialize with README if you're pushing from local

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **On Ubuntu: Create Your Project Folder**

```bash
mkdir devops-practice
cd devops-practice
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Initialize Git**

```bash
git init
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Create a File to Track**

```bash
nano commands.md
```

Write your commands like:

```
# Day 1 DevOps Practice
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Save (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl + X`)

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Stage and Commit the File**

```bash
git add commands.md
git commit -m "Added Day 1 DevOps commands"
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Connect Local Repo to GitHub Remote**

Use your GitHub repo link:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/AVAN1IKA/linux-practice-and-devops-notes.git
```

Set the branch:

```bash
git branch -M main
```

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Push to GitHub Using Personal Access Token**

Now push:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

> GitHub will ask:

```
Username: AVAN1IKA
Password: <PASTE YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN HERE>
```

### ‚õî Don't Use Your GitHub Password!

Instead, use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**

---

### üîê How to Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Fine-grained tokens"** or **"Classic tokens"**
3. Click **Generate new token**
4. Set expiry (e.g., 30 days)
5. Select scopes:

   * ‚úÖ `repo` (full control of private repositories)
6. Click **Generate token**
7. **Copy it immediately** and save somewhere safe

Use this token as the password when `git push` asks.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Verify Push on GitHub**

Go to your GitHub repo
You will see `commands.md` or any file you pushed.

---

## üß† Summary of Commands

```bash
mkdir devops-practice
cd devops-practice
git init
nano commands.md
git add commands.md
git commit -m "Added commands file"
git remote add origin https://github.com/AVAN1IKA/linux-practice-and-devops-notes.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then login:

* Username: `AVAN1IKA`
* Password: *Paste PAT (Personal Access Token)*
